|This Project was supposed to become an intricate hydration reminder that would track and remind you to drink water throughout the day. Unfortunately implementing local android notifications was not as easy as it sounds. Due to time constraints the app turned into just a simple reminder app that lets you input how much water you want to drink and how many reminders to send. When implementing notifications, I had a lot of trouble in the begining. Most tutorials I saw on notifications were outdated and depreciated. also the AndroidManifest.xml setup for notifications was vague. I was able to get the app to send Alarms to show a notification, but for the life of me, I could not get it to recieve. I ended up using a library called NotifyMe to use notifications on Android becaause of my strugles. After a look through the NotifyMe library, I found that my AndroidManifest.xml might have been the issue. I would like to implement my own library for local notifications someday since it was so convuluted to send just a simple notification.|
